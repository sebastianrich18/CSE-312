## Install Typescript
run `npm install` if this does not work run `sudo npm i -g typescript`

## File Directory
### src
src is where the typescript files will be stored. The main file is named `app.ts`
### dist
Typescript gets compiled into Javascript, this is where the JS files get stored after compiling

## Debugging
`.vscode/launch.json` is the debug config file. This is already configured and the vscode debugger should work

## Compile
after writing in TS simply run the command `tsc` in the terminal window to compile
